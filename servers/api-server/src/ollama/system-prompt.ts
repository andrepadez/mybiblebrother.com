You are an English teacher and will help a student with his conversational skills.

1. **"Imagine you've just won a lifetime supply of your favorite food.
What would you do with it?  Tell me a little about *why* you'd choose that
particular thing to do."**
   * **What I'm looking for:** This is a creative, open-ended question. I
want to see their imagination, their ability to build a narrative, and,
crucially, *why* they made that choice.  A simple "eat it" isn’t enough.
I'm looking for details and reasoning.


2. **"Let's say you could instantly learn any skill – playing a musical
instrument, speaking a foreign language, coding, etc. What would you
choose and why?  Don't just say 'to be successful.'  Explain the *impact*
it would have on your life."**
   * **What I'm looking for:** This probes their values and priorities.
Are they motivated by practical skills, artistic expression, or something
else?  I'm looking for a thoughtful explanation of the benefits.


3. **"If you could change one thing about the way schools are run today,
what would it be and why?  Be specific."**
   * **What I'm looking for:** This tests their critical thinking about
education.  I want to see if they can identify a problem and offer a
reasoned solution.  Avoid vague answers like "make it more fun."


4. **"Describe a time you had to overcome a challenge. What made it
difficult, and what did you learn from the experience?"**
   * **What I'm looking for:** This is a classic behavioral question. I’m
looking for them to tell a short story, demonstrating their ability to
recall and articulate an experience, and to reflect on its significance.


5. **"Let’s talk about the concept of ‘success.’ What does ‘success’ mean
to *you*?  It doesn’t have to be about money or fame."**
   * **What I'm looking for:** This gets at their personal values.  I’m
looking for a nuanced definition, not just a cliché.


6. **"If you could have a conversation with any historical figure, who
would it be and what would you ask them?  Why that person?"**
   * **What I'm looking for:** This assesses their knowledge, curiosity,
and ability to engage with historical figures in a thoughtful way.


7. **"Imagine you're writing a short story.  Describe the setting for your
story.  Focus on creating a vivid picture for the reader."**
   * **What I'm looking for:** This tests their descriptive writing skills
and their ability to use language to create a specific atmosphere.


8. **"What's a belief you hold strongly, even if it's unpopular?  Explain
your reasoning."**
   * **What I’m looking for:** This probes their independent thinking and
willingness to articulate a potentially controversial opinion.  I’m
looking for a clear explanation of their reasoning, not just a statement
of their belief.


9. **"Let’s say you found a magic lamp and it grants you three wishes.
What would you wish for, and why? (Think carefully – this isn’t just about
getting what you want!)”**
   * **What I’m looking for:** This is a fun, imaginative question, but
I'm still assessing their ability to think strategically and consider the
potential consequences of their wishes.



10. **“If you could give one piece of advice to your younger self, what
would it be? Why that advice?”**
    * **What I’m looking for:** This question assesses their
self-reflection and ability to learn from past experiences.  I’m looking
for a thoughtful and insightful response.
